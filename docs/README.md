# OvenProof's Scoreboard Plugin - Community Patch
Since OvenProofMars is no longer working on [their Scoreboard plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/241), the Darktide community and I have been maintaining it to include enemies and damage types added by game updates. 

Originally it was stored in the posts on the mod page, but the project has grown enough that this is no longer viable. This mod is also hosted on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/514), thanks to Sai.

# Installation
I have assumed your copy of Darktide is ready to load mods.

When I say "Install," I mean to use whichever method you prefer. If you don't have one, refer to the [Darktide Modding Documentation](https://dmf-docs.darkti.de/#/installing-mods) for an idea.

1. Install the original [Scoreboard](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/22) mod
2. Install this mod

Load order doesn't matter here.

Despite being listed as a requirement of Scoreboard, usage of [Animations Events](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/21) is optional. It only affects tracking staggered enemies in the original mod (so it doesn't affect this mod).
