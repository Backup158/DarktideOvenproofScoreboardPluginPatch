v1.2.0-beta-branch

- Removed "buffs" from melee damage types
    - Concerns of it affecting the warpfire and bleed counts
- Added ammo pickup modifiers from Havoc (pickups give less)
    - Check if mission is Havoc when starting a mission
    - If so, set the ammo modifier from the Havoc settings template
- Some code reorganizing to make it easier for me to read
